# Square wave mini keyboard

This is something I cretaed whitin a day, board and code. Have been trying to prone my pcb making skills.

This is inpired by the [8-Bit Capacitive Synth](https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001045893?_ga=2.258280015.458448953.1538141580-1372417667.1536370002) from Bantam tools.


## Features

Sound part, nothing special, just a single plain sqaure wave.

The board uses capcitive pads, my fisrt time experimenting with em, I'm quite impresssed with the simplicity and reliability.
